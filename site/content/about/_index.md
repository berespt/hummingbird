    Hummingbird Blues has been going on since 2015. It is a blues dancing
    exchange based in Cracow, where we dance mad, chill hard and share crazy.
    There is no regular classes and no competitions. Instead we have lots of
    daytime activities, lots of music and sliding pricing scale to keep the
    event inclusive.

      Our event is not only about dancing, we want to hang out together during a
      day. Part of that will be skill sharing sessions and other activities.

      It already became our tradition. Saturday meal is an excellent opportunity
      to get to know each other. Whether you are a vegan or a meat lover, you
      will find something for yourself. There will be a number of different
      options to choose from.
