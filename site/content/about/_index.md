    Hummingbird Blues is organised annually since 2015. It is an international
    blues dancing exchange taking place in Krakow, where we dance mad, chill
    hard and share crazy.\

    Expect all-night dancing to blues and fusion music and lots of daytime
    activities. \

    You can register without a partner. Don't worry about role imbalance - we
    believe in switching!

      Part of our daytime activities will be skill sharing sessions. So far
      we've had all sorts of topics: from hugging through meditation to Polish
      folk dance. This year's agenda depends only on you, folks!

      It has become our tradition. Preparing Saturday meal is an excellent
      opportunity to get to know each other. Whether you are a vegan or a meat
      lover, you will find something for yourself. There will be a number of
      different options to choose from.

      To be honest, each year's Sunday is a surprise even for us. The only
      certain thing is [pierogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi).
