    HB has been going on since 2015. It is a blues dancing
    exchange based in Cracow, where we dance mad, chill hard and share crazy.
    You can expect dancing till dawn to blues and fusion music, lots of daytime activites and lots of pierogi. You can register without a partner. Don't worry about role unbalance - we believe in switching!

      It already became our tradition. Preparing Saturday meal is an excellent
      opportunity to get to know each other. Whether you are a vegan or a meat
      lover, you will find something for yourself. There will be a number of
      different options to choose from.

      To be honest, each year's Sunday is a surprise even for us. The only certain thing is [pierogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi).
