    HB has been going on since 2015. It is a blues dancing exchange based in
    Cracow, where we dance mad, chill hard and share crazy. 


    Expect dancing till dawn to blues and fusion music, lots of daytime
    activites and lots of pierogi. 


    You can register without a partner. Don't worry about role unbalance - we
    believe in switching!

      Part of our daytime activities will be skill sharing sessions. So far we
      had all sorts of topics: from hugging through meditation to Polish folk.
      This year's agenda depends only on us, folks!

      It already became our tradition. Preparing Saturday meal is an excellent
      opportunity to get to know each other. Whether you are a vegan or a meat
      lover, you will find something for yourself. There will be a number of
      different options to choose from.

      To be honest, each year's Sunday is a surprise even for us. The only
      certain thing is [pierogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi).
