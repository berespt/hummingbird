    The only way to buy the ticket is through the **Indiegogo campaign** (after
    registering you will receive the link).


    You can choose to pay for the ticket only or support our exchange by
    donating some more money and buying perks. Additional donations will allow
    us to boost up our event with more bands, better dance floors and generally
    more goodies.


    If you'd like to join the event but the price is an obstacle, contact us and
    we'll see what we can do.


    Please fill in the **registration form** and wait for the confirmation
    e-mail with the payment link. 


    ## Update


    We freaked out a bit because of number of people registering.


    **The perks on indiegogo will become hidden, but no worries! We already
    sorted it out.**


    Just fill in the registration form, and we'll take care of the rest.
