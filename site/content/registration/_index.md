    In order to register for the event:


    1. Fill in the registration form. You will receive a copy of the
    registration form on your email account.

    2. The next email you'll receive will be a confirmation saying that you have
    a spot.

    3. Back us on Indiegogo campaign with the perk you chose in the form.
    Because the number of places is limited, **please hold on with the payment**
    until you receive the confirmation email.


    You can choose to pay for the ticket only or support our exchange by
    donating some more money and buying perks. Additional donations will allow
    us to boost up our event with more bands, better dance floors and generally
    more goodies.


    If you'd like to join the event but the price is an obstacle, contact us and
    we'll see what we can do.


    Please fill in the **registration form** and wait for the confirmation
    email.


    If you buy perks without filling the registration form we do not guarantee
    you a spot.
