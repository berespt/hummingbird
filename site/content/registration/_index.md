    Since we want to make our event as inclusive as possible, we try to keep the
    ticket prices low. We also have a desire to keep the cozy atmosphere here,
    so we could connect with everyone and still have time for dancing.


    That is why we decided to crowdfund this event. You can support our exchange
    by donating some more money or buying perks. Thanks to extra donations we
    are able to boost up our event with more bands, better dancefloors, and
    generally more less dance-oriented goodies.


    However cool it is to triple the suggested costs of the event and have many
    live bands, foods and floors that donâ€™t leave splinters in your feet, HB2018
    is gonna be awesome regardless of its price!
