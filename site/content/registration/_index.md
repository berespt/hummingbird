    The only way to buy the ticket is through the __Indiegogo campaign__.


    You can choose to pay for the ticket only or support our exchange by
    donating some more money and buying perks. Additional donations will allow
    us to boost up our event with more bands, better dance floors and generally
    more goodies.


    If you'd like to join the event but the price is an obstacle, contact us and
    we'll see what we can do.


    Remember to fill in the __Registration form__ after you back us on
    __Indiegogo__.


    Links to the campaign and the registration form will appear 4th April. Stay
    tuned!
