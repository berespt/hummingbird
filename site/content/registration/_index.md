    The only way to buy the ticket is through **Indiegogo** campaign.


    You can choose just a ticket or support our exchange by donating some more
    money or buying perks. Thanks to extra donations we are able to boost up our
    event with more bands, better dancefloors and generally more goodies.


    If you want to join the event but the price is an obstacle for you, contact
    us and we'll see what we can do.


    After backing us on **Indiegogo** please don't forget to fill in the
    **registration form**.
