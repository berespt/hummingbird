    The only way to buy the ticket is through the __Indiegogo campaign__.


    You can choose to pay for the ticket only or support our exchange by donating some more money and buying perks. Additional donations will allow us to boost up our
    event with more bands, better dance floors and generally more goodies.


    If you'd like to join the event but the price is an obstacle, contact
    us and we'll see what we can do.


    Remember to fill in the __Registration form__ after you back us on __Indiegogo__.
