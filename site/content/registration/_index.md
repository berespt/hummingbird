    The only way to buy the ticket is through the **Indiegogo campaign**.


    You can choose to pay for the ticket only or support our exchange by
    donating some more money and buying perks. Additional donations will allow
    us to boost up our event with more bands, better dance floors and generally
    more goodies.


    If you'd like to join the event but the price is an obstacle, contact us and
    we'll see what we can do.
