        Skill sharing!

        Our event is not only about dancing, we want to hang out together during
        a day. Part of that will be skill sharing sessions and other activities.

        Let's cook together!

        It already became our tradition. Saturday meal is an excellent
        opportunity to get to know each other. Whether you are a vegan or a meat
        lover, you will find something for yourself. There will be a number of
        different options to choose from.

    Hummingbird Blues has been going on since 2015. It is a blues dancing
    exchange based in Cracow, where we dance mad, chill hard and share crazy.
    There is no regular classes and no competitions. Instead we have lots of
    daytime activities, lots of music and low entrance fee.

    Since we want to make our event as inclusive as possible, we try to keep the
    ticket prices low. We also have a desire to keep the cozy atmosphere here,
    so we could connect with everyone and still have time for dancing.


    That is why we decided to crowdfund this event. You can support our exchange
    by donating some more money or buying perks. Thanks to extra donations we
    are able to boost up our event with more bands, better dancefloors, and
    generally more less dance-oriented goodies.


    However cool it is to triple the suggested costs of the event and have many
    live bands, foods and floors that don’t leave splinters in your feet, HB2018
    is gonna be awesome regardless of its price!
