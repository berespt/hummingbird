        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    Hummingbird Blues has been going on since 2015. It is a blues dancing
    exchange based in Cracow, where we dance mad, chill hard and share crazy.
    There is no regular classes and no competitions. Instead we have lots of
    daytime activities, lots of music and low entrance fee.
pricing:

    Since we want to make our event as inclusive as possible, we try to keep the
    ticket prices low. We also have a desire to keep the cozy atmosphere here,
    so we could connect with everyone and still have time for dancing.


    That is why we decided to crowdfund this event. You can support our exchange
    by donating some more money or buying perks. Thanks to extra donations we
    are able to boost up our event with more bands, better dancefloors, and
    generally more less dance-oriented goodies.


    However cool it is to triple the suggested costs of the event and have many
    live bands, foods and floors that don’t leave splinters in your feet, HB2018
    is gonna be awesome regardless of its price!
