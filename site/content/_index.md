    heading: About us
    text: HB has been going on since 2015. It is a blues dancing
          exchange based in Cracow, where we dance mad, chill hard and share crazy.
          You can expect dancing till dawn to blues and fusion music, lots of daytime activites and lots of pierogi. You can register without a partner. Don't worry about role unbalance - we believe in switching!
