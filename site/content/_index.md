    Hummingbird Blues is organised annually since 2015. It is an international
    blues dancing exchange taking place in Krakow, where we dance mad, chill
    hard and share crazy.


    Expect all-night dancing to blues and fusion music, lots of daytime
    activites and tons of [pierogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi).


    You can register without a partner. Don't worry about role imbalance - we
    believe in switching!
