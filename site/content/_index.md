    heading: About us
    text: Hummingbird Blues has been going on since 2015. It is a blues dancing
          exchange based in Cracow, where we dance mad, chill hard and share crazy.
          There is no regular classes and no competitions. Instead we have lots of
          daytime activities, lots of music and low entrance fee.
