    HB has been going on since 2015. It is a blues dancing exchange based in
    Cracow, where we dance mad, chill hard and share crazy.


    Expect dancing till dawn to blues and fusion music, lots of daytime
    activities and lots of [pierogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi).


    You can register without a partner. Don't worry about role unbalance - we
    believe in switching!
