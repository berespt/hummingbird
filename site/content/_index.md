    Like our mascot, the Hummingbird – the most restless of all birds, we will
    be dancing with almost no breaks: from Friday evening, through parties,
    afterparties, daytime activities and meals together, until Monday morning.
    And than we will have a monday farewell party.

    Hummingbird Blues has been going on since 2015. It is a blues dancing
    exchange based in Cracow, where we dance mad, chill hard and share crazy.
    There is no regular classes and no competitions. Instead we have lots of
    daytime activities, lots of music and low entrance fee.
